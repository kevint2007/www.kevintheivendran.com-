### 🌾 AgriLanka
Working on a lease-to-own model for solar-powered irrigation pumps to aid smallholder farmers in Sri Lanka.

### 🛰️ Geospatial Market Intelligence System (Kenya)
Through ArcGIS Pro, I used satellite data to find "hidden markets" for solar energy. By analyzing night-light imagery (NASA) and population maps, I built an automated system to identify off-grid communities in Kenya that are large enough for investment but currently have zero electricity.

### 🌿 Villars Institute Ecopreneurship  
Selected for the Villars Institute’s Ecopreneurship program focused on systems thinking and regenerative innovation. Collaborating with global changemakers to design scalable solutions in the space of climate.

### ⚡ Mandulis Energy
Remote internship focused on clean energy access and biomass infrastructure in rural Uganda. Alongside my team, I worked on carbon credit certifications for renewable energy sites that would bring electricity to villages. 

### ☀️ Solar Subsidy Model
Wrote a paper to promote the use of AI in predicting solar viability and target subsidies in underserved regions. Currently testing with local partners.

### 🧠 The Knowledge Society
At The Knowledge Society, I had the opportunity to work with my peers on consulting projects with Microsoft and Maverick, which is an emerging biotech startup. We were named TKS Global Finalists for our outstanding recommendations.
